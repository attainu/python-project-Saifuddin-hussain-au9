Maze Solver.
A maze is a type of puzzle involving a collection of paths, usually where
a player has to find a route from start to finish.
A huge variety of algorithms exist for generating and solving mazes.
These are not only fun to implement, but also are a good way to
familiarise yourself with programming techniques, algorithms, and
languages.
Everyone seems to love a good maze - we've been into them for
thousands of years at this point.
Webster defines 'maze' as a confusing intricate network of passages,
and something confusingly elaborate or complicated.

There are many Algorithms to solve mazes, but here we have used The
Shortest Path-Finding Algorithms, which is Breadth-First Search (BFS)
and Depth-First Search (DFS) approach.

For more details, you can check the .py(Python) file for the code and .pdf file for more detailed documentation.
